Required Resources
==================

Before you begin you will require the following...

## A Text-Editor {.important}

We are assuming previous programming experience, however, if you would like a
recommendation, have a look at
[Atom](https://atom.io/),
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/). Just make sure that you are fluent enough to embark
on exercises as they appear in the workshop.

## [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) {.important}

In order to run the programs written during this workshop you will need a Haskell
installation. The easiest way to get up and running is to install Stack.

## [A Copy of the Workshop Github Project](https://github.com/sordina/compose_melbourne_2017_haskell_workshop.git)

The exercises in the project are available in runnable form in the workshop source.

You can grab the source from GitHub:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sordina/compose_melbourne_2017_haskell_workshop.git
```


Other Useful Resources {.collapse}
==================================

These resources are available to help you with any issues you face when learning Haskell:


## \#haskell on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/)

An IRC channel dedicated to discussion of Haskell. This is often the easiest place to fire off
a one-off question that is simple enough not to warrant a permanent listing on the internet.

## [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html)

Hackage is the primary repository for Haskell packages. It is public,
searchable, versioned, and uses Cabal package metadata for classification.
Furthermore, this can be used to easily browse package contents, documentation
and source-code.

For example, browse the [Shake](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake) package and look
at some of the [Modules](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/shake/0.10.6/doc/html/Development-Shake-Command.html).


## [Hoogle](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/)

Hoogle is a Haskell module and function search-engine. Hoogle allows you to
take advantage of the granular type-system used by Haskell to search not just
for function-names, but for function type-signatures.

For example, have a look for the function with signature [Text -> ByteString](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=Text+-%3E+ByteString).

## [/r/haskell](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell)

For Reddit users, /r/haskell is a very useful resource with a great deal of
information regarding recent developments in the Haskell ecosystem and community.
This is a good place to ask some more advanced questions or start a flame-war.

## [Learn You a Haskell (For Great Good)](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

Learn You a Haskell (For Great Good) is a wonderful introductory text on Haskell.

## [Learn you a Haskell - In a Nutshell](https://gist.github.com/mikehaertl/3258427)

A compressed Gist of Learn You a Haskell!

## [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/)

The latest and greatest comprehensive text for learning Haskell.

## [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html)

Another well renowned and modern resource for learning Haskell.

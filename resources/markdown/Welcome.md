# Welcome

<div class="important">

Welcome to the Compose :: Melbourne 2016 Haskell Workshop.

Running on Day-Two of [Compose :: Melbourne.](http://www.composeconference.org)

This intent of this workshop is to provide a working introduction to Haskell
for programmers in Melbourne who have not yet used the language in anger.

The workshop is split into chapters. The chapters will start
with a few trivial introductory exercises to get your fingers warmed up,
then the meat - exercises that should be able to be solved using the material
introduced up to that point (with help and hints available if needed).

At the beginning of each chapter will be a small listing of terms, so that you
know what you can expect to encounter throughout the text of the chapter.
This isn't intended to function as a glossary, but simply give you a heads-up
on the scope and let you know what's coming up!

Each chapter will conclude with an open-question. This question should provide
inspiration for further consideration of how harder problems could
be solved using Haskell, and for more advanced attendees, can be attacked
instead of twiddling your thumbs after finishing the main exercise.
